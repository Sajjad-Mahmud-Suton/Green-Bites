Prompt:
"I am building a web-based canteen management system called Green Bites. It is a modern online platform where students can check the menu, view daily specials, place food orders, track order status, select table numbers, visualize table availability, and submit food complaints with images. The system also includes an admin dashboard to update menu items, manage daily specials, monitor orders, and view complaints.

The project will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Firebase (Realtime Database/Firestore + Storage + optional Authentication). Key features include:

Interactive digital menu with daily specials highlight

Real-time table availability visualization

Online food ordering with live order status updates

Complaint submission system with image upload

Admin dashboard for order, menu, and complaint management

Using this information, assist me with project proposal writing, documentation, feature explanation, UI ideas, database structure, flow diagrams, and any other help I may need."
